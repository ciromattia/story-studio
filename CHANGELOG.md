# Changelog

This changelog is intentionally concise. It summarizes the main public features
added to Story Studio over time, without mirroring every internal commit.

GitHub Releases carry the detailed notes and downloadable installers for each
public version; this file stays as the concise project history.

## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.9.6] - 2026-07-30

Story Studio v0.9.6 brings the complete desktop editor to Linux x86_64 and
macOS Apple Silicon while preserving the existing Windows x64 experience.

### Added

- Added native Linux packages for AppImage, Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora, plus a
  macOS Apple Silicon app and DMG alongside the existing Windows installers.
- Added bundled, integrity-pinned FFmpeg and 7-Zip tools for every supported
  platform, so interactive shell configuration is not required.
- Added reproducible native Piper 1.6 runtimes for Windows x64, Linux x86_64
  and macOS Apple Silicon, with their source provenance and license notices.
- Added XTTS support on Linux in CPU-only mode.

### Changed

- Ported filesystem permissions, cache locations, process launchers and
  external-tool resolution to Windows, Linux and macOS boundaries.
- Hardened downloads, archive extraction, generated-pack publication and
  user-selected path handling across desktop filesystems.
- Unified local audio playback through Web Audio and Tauri asset streaming for
  consistent FLAC and preview behavior across desktop webviews.
- Improved image filters, hidden asset handling and diagram pinch gestures
  across WebView2, WebKitGTK and WebKit.

### Fixed

- Fixed Fedora startup, taskbar identity and packaging regressions.
- Fixed imported end-message destinations and preserved story names during
  pack import.
- Fixed frontend-visible temporary files on macOS and Linux by keeping them in
  application-owned cache locations.
- Fixed media-removal and pack-start wording so destructive actions and
  navigation destinations are explicit.

### Platform notes

- macOS builds target Apple Silicon only, are ad-hoc signed and are not
  notarized; Gatekeeper may require an explicit first launch.
- XTTS was not installed or manually validated on macOS. ComfyUI was manually
  validated on Windows only; manual Linux and macOS ComfyUI tests were not run.

---

## [0.9.5] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- Restored authoring import compatibility for Story Studio 0.9.3 packs whose
  global next-story end message returns the final story of nested folders to
  the main menu.

---

## [0.9.4] - 2026-07-21

Story Studio v0.9.4 introduces a unified and customizable editing workspace,
a clearer level-based diagram, reusable media workflows and stronger
end-of-story fidelity across imported packs, simulation and generation.

### Added

- Added a unified workspace combining the project tree, node settings and
  diagram in three independently visible, resizable and reorderable panels.
  Panel order, visibility and preferred widths are preserved between sessions.
- Added a permanent level-based diagram with collapsible story groups,
  selectable navigation relationships, pinned return paths, branch focus,
  breadcrumbs and improved trackpad zoom.
- Added contextual audio tools from the tree and diagram. Audio can be opened
  directly in the splitter or assembly tool, and compatible consecutive stories
  can be replaced atomically by their assembled result.
- Added image editing directly from the Media explorer. Edited images are saved
  as durable, non-destructive derivatives that can be reused in several project
  fields.
- Added explicit silent selection screens for stories that intentionally have
  no title audio, while continuing to reject accidentally missing audio.
- Added inline tree-node renaming and shared color filters in the tree and
  diagram searches.
- Added advanced import and audio settings, including optional recovery from
  unsupported packs and configurable leading/trailing silence durations.
- Added a three-state playback control for global end messages, including
  imported mixed states, one-step normalization to automatic or OK-confirmed
  playback, and matching behavior in project simulation and generated packs.

### Changed

- Turned the Media explorer into a durable project catalogue. Removing a story,
  folder or media assignment now preserves its files in Media; permanent disk
  deletion is centralized there and remains blocked while a file is in use.
- Unified end-of-story presentation around three explicit states: the pack
  message, a local ending, or no end message. Editors, diagrams, navigation
  summaries and simulators now consume the same effective classification.
- Reworked compact story groups and return paths so large, deeply nested packs
  remain readable without hiding their effective destinations.
- Improved synchronization between the tree, diagram, settings and simulator,
  including multi-selection, external selections and configured end-message
  routes.
- Improved YouTube imports with pagination, clearer selection wording and
  natural ordering for numbered channel series.
- Displayed audio durations without requiring playback first, simplified
  microphone recording and clarified contextual assembly and multi-selection
  destinations.
- Reduced initial frontend loading work, split large application areas into
  focused modules and expanded CI with version consistency, lint and pure
  JavaScript test checks.

### Fixed

- Fixed Home, OK, `next_story`, local-ending and global-ending navigation
  differences between Rust generation, the JavaScript mirror, ProjectSimulator
  and ZipSimulator.
- Fixed multi-node moves so parent/child selections remain hierarchical and
  each operation produces one coherent undo step.
- Fixed selection desynchronization between the tree, diagram, validation
  actions and simulator.
- Fixed recovery snapshot races, shortcut migration, temporary audio-preview
  cleanup and out-of-order preview generation.
- Fixed persistence and transfer of standalone media, contextual audio results
  and edited-image metadata across saves, recovery sessions and workspace
  promotion.
- Fixed imported pack UUID handling, media search normalization, generated-image
  thumbnail alignment, narrow-panel layouts and pack-silence option sizing.

---

## [0.9.3] - 2026-07-03

Story Studio v0.9.3 adds an assisted workflow layer on top of the existing
editor: a redesigned home screen, guided import/generation funnels, ephemeral
sessions, zero-config local voice generation, YouTube import and stronger
imported-pack fidelity.

### Added

- Added a redesigned home screen centered on guided workflows: edit an existing
  pack, create from a podcast, create from YouTube, aggregate packs and
  check/correct a community pack.
- Added a reusable funnel chassis with shared modal layout, stepper, drop zones,
  tool buttons, generation progress and final states.
- Added ephemeral project sessions so new work can start without choosing a
  `.mbah` file first, with optional save prompts, crash recovery snapshots and
  cleanup of temporary workspaces.
- Added Piper as the default zero-config local TTS backend, with automatic
  runtime provisioning of the engine and French voices.
- Added YouTube import through runtime-downloaded `yt-dlp`, including video,
  playlist and channel listing, thumbnail import and editor insertion.
- Added a generative aggregate-packs funnel that builds a new pack directly from
  several ZIP/7z packs without opening the full editor.
- Added shared reference entries for imported branching graphs, including tree,
  editor, diagram, simulator, validation and native export support.
- Added a canonical fidelity judge and baseline coverage for imported packs.
- Added a session-media triage step before cleaning up ephemeral sessions, so
  unused generated/imported media can be kept or discarded intentionally.

### Changed

- Reworked imported pack projection around native graph classification, shared
  entries and canonical fidelity checks; complex packs that cannot be edited
  safely are kept out of the editable path.
- Improved the edit-existing-pack flow with dry-run editability checks, folder
  pack conversion, metadata prefill and suggested version bumps at generation.
- Moved the community pack checker out of Preferences into its own guided
  home-screen tool and refined the correction flow.
- Enabled autosave by default for saved projects while keeping explicit user
  opt-outs, and skipped empty simple-mode recovery snapshots.
- Improved audio handling for generated and corrected packs, including silence
  alignment with official packs and clearer generation controls.
- Simplified generation and options UI, tightened funnel sizing and refreshed
  French wording around save states, placeholders, checker messages and labels.
- Added ESLint and Knip configuration, then removed stale JS/Rust helpers,
  duplicated hooks and obsolete native graph fallback code.

### Fixed

- Fixed imported aggregate handling, duplicate imported entry names and imported
  pack UUID/name recovery.
- Fixed several navigation edge cases around refs, implicit Home playback,
  root/virtual after-play returns, generated navigation badges and simulator
  end-node selection.
- Fixed global shortcuts leaking through modals, inline overlays and dialogs.
- Fixed ephemeral promotion failure handling, tag-only media triage and transfer
  copy reuse.
- Fixed compact editor layouts, after-play controls, diagram return rails, tree
  panel minimum width and pack-checker stale styles.
- Fixed post-recording deletion, render queue close controls, archive labels,
  Piper feedback and remaining import notice wording.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-18

Story Studio v0.9.2 focuses on making pack preparation easier to understand:
community pack checking, a cleaner audio pipeline, podcast import, audio
splitting and a complete UI redesign around clearer navigation and actions.

### Added

- Added a community pack checker/corrector for ZIP packs, with analysis for
  structure, navigation, metadata, images, audio loudness, edge silences and
  saturated sources.
- Added an HTML export for community pack checker reports.
- Added dedicated checker states for audio that is already saturated at the
  source, with a clear "not correctable" warning instead of pretending the
  distortion can be repaired automatically.
- Added podcast RSS import so episodes can be brought into a project more
  directly.
- Added an audio splitter to cut an audio file before using it in a story,
  menu, assembly or generated pack.
- Added launcher buttons to open project and ZIP simulation more directly.
- Added navigation rails and clearer diagram path highlighting so users can
  better understand where they are and how stories return or chain together.
- Added image level controls and conversion for Lunii-unsupported image
  formats.

### Changed

- Redesigned the application UI for better comprehension, including the app
  chrome, toolbar, project/generation/options popovers, buttons, dialog actions,
  light theme, validation states and editor layouts.
- Reworked audio preparation around a `-14 LUFS` target, static gain,
  peak limiting at `-2 dBFS`, and shared rules between the checker and native
  generator. `loudnorm` is no longer used as the final correction path.
- Kept working audio in FLAC until final export to avoid repeated lossy MP3
  compression during edits and replacements.
- Normalized leading and trailing silence by measuring each file first, then
  setting clean edge silence to about `0.5 s` instead of blindly adding silence.
- Made pack loudness correction and silence correction independent, so fixing
  one no longer unexpectedly changes the other.
- Improved the tree workflow with toolbar search, steadier folder drag/drop,
  multi-selection expand/collapse and clearer display options.
- Improved missing-media relinking, audio replacement in place, edited audio
  preview refresh and reuse of original audio sources after editing.
- Refined the AI queue, home screen actions and audio trim controls.
- Removed obsolete global selection options and simplified pack metadata copy.

### Fixed

- Fixed legacy workspace media path handling.
- Fixed project naming when unpacking ZIP packs.
- Fixed thumbnail export so generated thumbnails are forced to PNG.
- Fixed end-node deletion and confirmation edge cases.
- Fixed duplicate native tooltips and the audio original restore workflow.
- Fixed autoplay preview behavior to match generated packs more closely.
- Fixed compact layouts for audio controls, root menus, dialogs, popovers and
  central editor panels.
- Fixed several navigation, validation, keyboard shortcut, media explorer and
  generated pack edge cases discovered during the 0.9.2 redesign.

---

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-01

Story Studio v0.9.1 is a maintenance and architecture release focused on
making the project easier to understand, test and extend after the first public
beta releases.

### Changed

- Reorganized the native Rust pack generation engine into smaller, focused
  modules for assets, document building, stage writing, returns, night mode and
  imported ZIP handling.
- Split pack import, project file operations, ComfyUI services and audio edit
  workflows into clearer service boundaries.
- Simplified the project model around `rootEntries`: legacy `rootItems` and
  `menus` are migrated on load but are no longer saved or sent to Rust.
- Replaced native frontend error/confirmation dialogs with the shared Story
  Studio dialog and aligned frontend log event names on `module:action`.
- Shared frontend tree operations between the tree panel and diagram views, and
  extracted several large UI/audio/image editor areas into smaller helpers and
  hooks.
- Improved diagram navigation readability with highlighted return paths, clearer
  route labels/icons and a resizable settings panel.
- Improved tree return badges with clearer default/override states, better
  spacing, route arrows and dedicated visibility controls.
- Improved tree badge, simulator, image editor, media explorer and audio editor
  behavior discovered during the architecture cleanup.

### Added

- Added `npm run convert:legacy-project` to convert older `.mbah` files to the
  current rootEntries-only project shape, with overwrite protection by default.
- Added synthetic Rust round-trip coverage for generated packs, night-mode packs
  and imported native graphs.
- Added local audit scripts for dead code and import cleanup.
- Added recent-project thumbnails on the home screen.
- Added streamed generation logs and cancel support for the render queue.

### Fixed

- Prevented `scoped_label_id` collisions for entries sharing the same first
  eight ID characters.
- Hardened XTTS output filenames and recording names against path-like or
  overly long values.
- Fixed missing-media relinking, imported audio cover extraction, generated
  media drops, image edit metadata, image filter framing and audio waveform sync.
- Fixed several navigation, end-node, import, generated-media, waveform and
  compact-layout edge cases found while validating the reorganized code.

### Performance

- Parallelized native pack asset preprocessing with Rayon so audio conversion
  through FFmpeg, image resizing and imported ZIP preparation can run across
  multiple CPU cores before the final deterministic staging step.
- Lazy-loaded heavy audio and image editor modals, reduced tree drag/drop churn
  and cached tree badge data for smoother large-project editing.

---

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- French README and French setup/release documentation for XTTS, ComfyUI and
  release workflows.
- GitHub Pages landing site under `docs/` introducing the project with
  screenshots and feature highlights.
- Configurable keyboard shortcuts, with shortcuts grouped by context so editor,
  tree and audio-editor actions can be tuned independently.
- Diagnostic preferences for beta debugging, including opt-in logs, resolved log
  paths and clearer bug-report guidance.

### Changed

- Replaced the app logo and favicon with SVG assets and regenerated Tauri
  application icons.
- Redesigned navigation badges in the project tree as tinted square icons with
  a unified OKLCH palette and clearer tooltips.
- Renamed multi-selection and end-node editor sections to "Pendant la lecture"
  / "Après la lecture" for a clearer split between active controls and
  post-playback destinations.
- Replaced native dropdowns in every navigation destination field with a custom
  listbox showing Lucide icons (folder, music, play) consistent with the
  project tree, grouped by category and keyboard-accessible.
- Renamed the "Début du pack" destination to "Première entrée du pack" to match
  what the firmware actually navigates to.
- Each navigation dropdown now shows the resolved destination inline
  (e.g. `↳ Quelle histoire... (premier élément du pack)`) so users see where a
  default or contextual setting actually leads.
- The story editor's "Après la lecture" card now chains a second pill showing
  the destination reached after the end-node bridge
  (`Passe par le nœud de fin du pack → Mini Loup à l'école`).
- Separated the project name (local identity used for file prefixes, window
  title and the `.mbah` filename) from the published pack name (community
  convention with age, title, author, version, producer, bonus). The pack
  card in the central panel has been removed; pack metadata is now edited
  through a dedicated modal opened from the title bar or the toolbar split
  button. Existing projects are migrated automatically on load — the legacy
  free-text pack name is parsed into structured fields or preserved as a
  legacy export name.
- Refactored the title bar into a breadcrumb (Story Studio › project name ›
  pack title) with a clickable pack recap that opens the metadata modal, a
  save indicator, and consistent project tooltips on every element.
- Replaced the central "Générer le pack" CTA with a split button in the
  toolbar offering "Generate now", "Edit metadata…" and "Open export folder".
- File prefixes for imported media, recordings, XTTS output, ComfyUI output
  and audio assemblies now derive from the project name (short and stable)
  instead of the full conventional pack name, producing shorter and more
  identifiable filenames.
- Root editor card "Menu Racine" rewords the image section: subtitle adapts
  to the chosen mode ("Affichée sur la Lunii et utilisée comme image de
  catalogue (320×240)" vs "Une image pour la Lunii, une pour les
  catalogues"), and the split slots are renamed "Écran Lunii (320×240)" and
  "Vignette bibliothèque" instead of device-specific labels.
- Replaced the persistent right-side validation panel with a compact toolbar
  validation pill that groups blocking issues and jumps directly to the
  affected node.
- Split validation feedback into blocking errors and items still to complete, so
  the toolbar badge better matches what prevents generation.
- Unified the media explorer search and filter controls for a quieter, more
  consistent library workflow.
- Improved simple-story mode and compact desktop layouts so editor surfaces stay
  usable on smaller windows.
- Clarified the story "Après la lecture" card: controls available during
  playback are separated from end-of-story behavior, automatic end-node routing
  is shown as a generated-pack fact, and optional custom end messages stay in
  advanced settings by default.
- Refreshed the README screenshots with the current pack workspace, story
  editor and pack metadata flows.

### Fixed

- Fixed Rust 1.95 Clippy compatibility for the public CI toolchain.
- Serialized local XTTS and ComfyUI generation queues to avoid launching many
  heavy AI jobs at once and exhausting system memory.
- Fixed Windows audio edit paths after trim/cut operations, made edited audio
  originals visible next to the edited file, and kept those backup files out of
  media scans unless they are explicitly referenced by the project.
- End-of-story node now appears in the tree, diagram and flow views as soon as
  it is added from the context menu, even before its audio is configured.
- Fixed Home navigation badge visibility on stories when an end node is active,
  and removed a misleading per-story badge that mirrored a global setting.
- Preserved the per-pack end-node Home return target when loading packs from
  disk so imported community packs keep their configured night-mode home.
- Allowed pack metadata to specify a version number without requiring an
  author field.
- Simplified empty-state actions in the media explorer.
- Navigation destinations shown in editors and diagrams now reflect the actual
  generated behavior, including the `autoNext` next-story shortcut, contextual
  `next_story` resolution per source story, and the end-node fallback that
  inherits each story's own return target when no global destination is set.
- Project tree badges now focus on direct navigation overrides and hide
  advanced end-flow details such as end messages, end sequences and imported
  end-node returns.
- The story "Accueil" selector once again anchors its default destination with
  an explicit `Réglage par défaut : ...` hint.
- Validation issue selection now closes the toolbar dropdown immediately, and
  its keyboard handling no longer intercepts keys outside the validation menu.
- Bottom-bar tab pills stay hidden while the side panel is open, avoiding
  duplicated navigation controls in constrained layouts.
