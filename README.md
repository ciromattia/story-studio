## Tu cherches a creer des histoires pour la Lunii ?

Story Studio pour Lunii est un editeur desktop open source pour creer, importer,
verifier et exporter des packs d'histoires compatibles Lunii. La documentation
francaise est disponible ici : [README.fr.md](README.fr.md).

Story Studio for Lunii lets you create, import, organize, test and export
Lunii-compatible story packs in a visual desktop workspace. Everything
stays local: images, audio, navigation, simulation and ZIP export.

Import your media, assemble and trim audio, crop images, organize menus and
story paths, then export a Lunii-compatible ZIP without juggling between
several tools.

> Story Studio is a community tool. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
> sponsored by Lunii.

## Beta Status

Story Studio is currently in beta. The app is usable, but it may still contain
bugs, edge cases and compatibility issues with some community packs. Please keep
backup copies of important projects and report reproducible problems through
GitHub issues.

## Latest Release

Story Studio 0.9.6 brings the complete desktop editor to Linux x86_64 and
macOS Apple Silicon alongside Windows x64. It also adds native Piper 1.6
runtimes, hardens cross-platform file and tool handling, and fixes several
audio, image and pack-import regressions.

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/Hugs11/story-studio/releases/latest)
- [Read the v0.9.6 release notes](https://github.com/Hugs11/story-studio/releases/tag/v0.9.6)
- [See the full changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## Demo packs

Discover Story Studio with two ready-to-open packs that you can explore in the
simulator and adapt in the editor:

  </tr>
</table>

To explore a pack in Story Studio:

1. Download its ZIP file from Proton Drive.
2. Launch Story Studio and click **Modify an existing pack**.
3. Select the downloaded `.zip` file.

These packs are distributed separately from the software. Their stories, audio
files and illustrations are not covered by Story Studio's MIT license.

## From first import to finished pack

Story Studio keeps the complete workflow in one local application: start from
your own files or an existing pack, prepare the media, build the navigation,
test the result and export a pack ready for the story box.

### 1. Start a project or import existing stories

Start however you like, reopen saved work, edit an existing ZIP/7z pack, or
start from a podcast or YouTube source. Dedicated guided flows also let you
aggregate several packs or inspect a community pack.

### 2. Prepare the audio

Import or record audio, then adjust it before using it in a story. A long
recording can be split into reusable clips, while several files can be reordered
and assembled into a single track without changing the originals.

| Split one recording into clips | Assemble several files into one track |
|---|---|
| ![Audio splitter with several prepared clips](docs/assets/screenshots/Audio-decoupe-light.png) | ![Audio assembly with reorderable source files](docs/assets/screenshots/Audio-assemble-light.png) |

### 3. Create voices, generate artwork and adapt images

Generate voices locally with zero-config Piper or use XTTS for advanced voice
cloning. ComfyUI can produce illustrations through a local service, with both
voice and image jobs followed from Story Studio's generation queues.

| Generate a voice locally with Piper or XTTS | Generate an illustration with ComfyUI |
|---|---|
| ![Local voice generation with Piper](docs/assets/screenshots/voice-generation-dark.png) | ![Illustration generation with a ComfyUI workflow](docs/assets/screenshots/comfyui-generation-dark.png) |

Images can then be cropped, resized and adjusted for the 320x240 story-box
format.

![Cropping and adjusting an image for the story box](docs/assets/screenshots/image-editor-dark.png)

### 4. Organize the story and test its navigation

Build menus and stories in the tree, assign their images and audio, and define
what the buttons do during and after playback. The Media explorer keeps used
and unused files available alongside the project.

![Unified workspace with the tree, story settings and diagram](docs/assets/screenshots/workspace-dark.png)

Open the diagram full-screen to understand the complete structure, story groups
and return paths without losing the level-by-level organization.

![Full level-based diagram of a large story pack](docs/assets/screenshots/diagram-full-dark.png)

The floating simulator then lets you play through the same navigation directly
on top of the diagram before exporting.

### 5. Review the settings and generate the pack

Check the public metadata, cover, filename and pack-wide audio or navigation
options. Story Studio reports whether the project is ready, then generates the
Lunii-compatible ZIP from the same workspace.

| Review pack metadata before export | Adjust pack-wide generation settings |
|---|---|
| ![Pack metadata and generated filename](docs/assets/screenshots/pack-metadata-dark.png) | ![Pack audio and navigation settings](docs/assets/screenshots/Pack-settings.png) |

Existing community packs can also be analyzed separately. The checker groups
structural, image and audio findings, proposes safe corrections and can export
a detailed report.

## Why Story Studio?

I was looking for a simple tool to create audio stories for my child. As a
former video editor, I could never find in existing tools what felt essential
to me: a visual and straightforward interface that makes building a narrative
fluid and frictionless, without relying on command-line tools or dealing with
complex folder structures.

Story Studio was born from that need: bringing import, images, audio,
navigation, simulation and export into one clear local workspace.

## Requirements

| Platform | Requirements and limits |
|---|---|
| Windows x64 | Windows 10 or later with WebView2 |
| Linux x86_64 | A glibc-based distribution with WebKitGTK 4.1 and the usual GStreamer codecs; AppImage, DEB and RPM packages are available |
| macOS Apple Silicon | macOS 11 or later on an M1-or-newer Mac; Intel Macs are not supported |

Bundled third-party binaries keep their own licenses and pinned provenance —
see [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) and the
[corresponding-source offer](THIRD_PARTY_SOURCE_OFFER.md).

## Installation

Download the package for your platform from the
[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Hugs11/story-studio/releases/latest):

- **Windows x64:** use the EXE installer, or the MSI package for managed
  deployments.
- **AppImage:** make the file executable with `chmod +x Story-Studio*.AppImage`,
  then run it.
- **Debian/Ubuntu:** install the downloaded DEB with
  `sudo apt install ./Story-Studio*.deb`.
- **Fedora:** install the downloaded RPM with
  `sudo dnf install ./Story-Studio*.rpm`.
- **macOS Apple Silicon:** open the DMG, drag Story Studio into Applications,
  then launch the app.

The macOS build has no Developer ID certificate and is not notarized. Gatekeeper
may therefore block its first launch. In Finder, Control-click the app and
choose **Open**, or use **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**.
Do not disable Gatekeeper globally.

AI integrations are optional. XTTS is validated on Linux in CPU-only mode and
does not require an NVIDIA driver; it has not been installed or manually
validated on macOS for 0.9.6. ComfyUI is manually validated on Windows only:
manual Linux and macOS tests have not been run.

To build from source or contribute, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Project Files and Workspace

Story Studio saves projects as `.mbah` files. Runtime assets are organized in
managed workspace folders:

| Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `fichiers-importes/` | Imported media files when copy-on-import is enabled |
| `enregistrements/` | Microphone recordings |
| `voix-generees/` | XTTS-generated voice clips |
| `images-generees/` | ComfyUI-generated and edited images |
| `zips-extraits/` | Unpacked ZIP collections |
| `sauvegardes/` | Default save folder and safety versions |
| `exports/` | Suggested output folder for generated packs |

Files in managed media folders use a `{project-name}__` prefix so multiple
projects can share the same workspace more safely.

Application data is stored under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.hugs11.story-studio` on
Windows, `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/com.hugs11.story-studio` on Linux,
and `~/Library/Application Support/com.hugs11.story-studio` on macOS.
User-selected files remain accessible outside these folders, including on
external macOS volumes under `/Volumes`.

When Story Studio offers to delete media from disk, it only deletes files inside
managed workspace media folders. External source files are removed from the
project or media library reference only.
